2. A function declaration defines the fuction's name, return type etc for the compiler
    While a function definition provides the body of the function.
 
 
3.Since the first pass allows Java to catalog the methods and the second allows Java to match the methods there is no need to declare the functions.
 While in C/C++ declaring a function allows us to tell the compiler that the function exist. From my understanding, if a function is not declared it will cause an error because the compiler does not know that the said function exist.

4. The C preprocessor simply manipulates text. To use it we would use the #include directive.
 
5. A header file allows us to organize commmonly used functions so that we can access them throughout our program without having to decclare them everytime.
 
8. MAX_VALUE is not a variable it is considered a macro in this example it will be replaced the preproccessor and become 32767 before the compiler sees it.
